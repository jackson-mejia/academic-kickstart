abstract: "I investigate the cross-sectional impact of tax shocks on investment with aggregate and firm-level data sources with two goals in mind. First,  I argue that there are significant overaggregation problems in the existing tax shock literature. Given the result that current measures of tax shocks have differing effects on different types of investment and legal forms, overaggregating the shock or the response variable will lead to biased estimates of the effect of tax shocks on the response variable if the composition of the aggregate has changed over time. Since intangibles have risen significantly over time, estimated multipliers are biased upward. Second, I seek to understand heterogeneity in firm-level response utilizing panel regressions and Jorda local projections because the cross-section is immune to the aggregation problem. I show that financially constrained firms, intangible-intensive, and multinational firms tend to exhibit little response to tax shocks, while large firms, dividend-payers, highly productive firms, and highly leveraged firms all react significantly. These results have important implications for future estimates of the impact of tax shocks."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This paper serves two goals. First, to illustrate that multipliers and elasticities estimated using overaggregated shock and/or response variables will be biased if there is heterogeneity in response by the components of the aggregate and there are time trends. Second, to illustrate the rich heterogeneity of firm-level responses to tax shocks."
