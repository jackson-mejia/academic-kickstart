abstract: Price stability and full employment are stated policy objectives for many economists, especially economists who subscribe to Modern Money Theory (MMT). To achieve both goals, MMT economists argue for instituting a federal job guarantee program, which they argue would help anchor overall prices. We examine whether this proposal would achieve price stability by extending a benchmark model of time inconsistency to include a job guarantee program. We show that a job guarantee program implemented through fiscal policy is incompatible with stable prices and would generate inflation. With discretion, policymakers have an incentive to target a smaller quantity of job guarantee workers than is consistent with stable prices. We compare this program to a similar proposal, a labor standard under monetary policy, and argue that the MMT proposal would result in worse price stability because of political incentives and informational constraints on policymakers.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We analyze a job guarantee implemented by fiscal policy and find that an inflation bias would emerge. We compare this to a similar proposal, a labor standard under monetary policy, and find that the labor standard would be a superior rule for monetary and price stability.
