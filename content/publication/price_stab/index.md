#abstract: Modern Money Theory (MMT) has risen to prominence in popular policy debates within
#macroeconomics. MMT economists argue for creating a job guarantee program, which
#they argue would generate price stability. Using a benchmark model of time consistency
#supplemented with a job guarantee, we conclude that once policymakersâ€™ incentives are
#considered, the job guarantee does nothing to help stabilize prices. We compare this
#program to a competing proposal to maintain price stability and full employment, NGDP
#targeting.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We analyze a job guarantee implemented by fiscal policy and find that an inflation bias would emerge. We compare this to a similar proposal, a labor standard under monetary policy, and find that the labor standard would be a superior rule for monetary and price stability.
