# abstract: "I investigate the cross-sectional impact of tax shocks on investment with aggregate and firm-level data sources and find two key results. First, current estimates of the impact of tax shocks on investment are biased because they fail to account for underlying heterogeneity in the components of investment and changes in the share of firms organized as pass-throughs. Second, I show that the firm-level corporate investment response to a one percentage point increase in the average corporate tax rate reaches a peak impact of -2% after two quarters and disappears within eight quarters. Additionally, I show that financially constrained firms exhibit a relatively smaller response to tax shocks than their unconstrained counterparts, which is consistent with the idea that the upward-sloping supply curve of capital dominates the flattening accelerator effect documented elsewhere. These results have important implications for future estimates of the impact of tax shocks."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: "This paper serves two goals. First, to illustrate that multipliers and elasticities estimated using overaggregated shock and/or response variables will be biased if there is heterogeneity in response by the components of the aggregate and there are time trends. Second, to illustrate the rich heterogeneity of firm-level responses to tax shocks."
