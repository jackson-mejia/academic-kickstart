# abstract: "A brief discussion of the weak investment response engendered by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) 2017 using initial findings from 10-K data filed by C corporations with the SEC. Following the passage of TCJA, it was widely thought that investment would increase because many provisions were favorable to increased investment, including a reduced statutory tax rate and 100% bonus depreciation for a limited period of time. But investment did not rise as much as predicted. I supply a few potential explanations for this: effective tax rates did not change much for major corporations, investment elasticities from other tax cuts were improperly applied, and political economy considerations were not considered enough."
